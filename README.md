 ## Project description
 
 This project is designed for Unit 2: Interactive Front-End Development, where the goal is to create a dynamic web application. For this project, I have developed Space Scramble, a fast-paced word game where players have 20 seconds to unscramble space-themed words of varying difficulty. The game will be designed with a focus on user interaction, leveraging responsive design and real-time gameplay to create an engaging experience for users.
 
 The core focus of this project is to apply the front-end development principles I have learned, demonstrating the ability to build an interactive, functional, and user-friendly web application.

 ## Design choices
 For Space Scramble, I created a vibrant, engaging design with a galaxy background to enhance the space theme. The colourful, cosmic backdrop adds depth and immerses players in the experience. This design creates a dynamic, fun environment that keeps players engaged.
 
 ### Typography choices
 **Primary Font:** Galindo
 Galindo was selected for headings and scrambled text, providing a bold, futuristic look that fits the space theme and remains highly readable.
 
 **Secondary Font:** Happy Monkey
 Happy Monkey was chosen for paragraph text due to its playful style, which contrasts with the boldness of Galindo while maintaining clarity and readability.
 
 ### Colour palette
 The dark blues and purples, including #3f0676 and #000560, enhance the galactic feel, while light-coloured fonts provide high contrast for improved readability. This colour scheme complements the immersive space atmosphere.
